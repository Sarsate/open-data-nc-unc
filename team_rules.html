	    <h5>Code Practices for code review / checkin/out </h5> <br>
                The team will use the following Gerrit workflow:<br><br>

		First, clone or pull the latest version of the gerrit repository.<br>
		<code> git clone http://173.230.133.53:8444/open-data-nc-unc </code><br><br>

		Checkout your own branch. All changes will be submitted on separate branches and merged into the master branch. DO NOT submit a patch on the master branch; your code will be rejected. <br>
		<code> git checkout -b my-branch </code> <br><br>

		Make your changes to the code and commit as usual <br>
		<code> git add myfile </code>  ( <code> git add --all </code> for all untracked files) <br>
		<code> git commit -a </code><br><br>

		**Make sure your commit message is descriptive of the change. The commit message should encompass the entirety of the patch. If you find yourself making an overly convoluted commit message, you probably need to split your commit into multiple commits. As a guideline, a single sentence is usually not enough. (i.e. "added new page to site" says nothing) **
		<br> <br>

		At this point, you can submit your branch for review on gerrit. If this is your first submission, you'll probably need to set up your credentials: <br>
		<code> git review -s </code> <br> <br>

		Then simply submit your patch! <br>
		<code> git review </code><br> <br>

		If you need to make changes to your patch based on comments/idea from others instead of creating a new commit (or you simply forgot that one semicolon), use git commit --amend: <br>
		<code> git commit -a --amend </code> <br>
		<code> git review </code> <br></br>

		As long as the Change-ID is the same in the commit message, your new patch will be submitted as a separate patch-set under the same review page as the previous patch, allowing others to easily see and be notified of your changes and you won't have to manually abandon your old change.<br><br>

		Once the patch is submitted the review protocol will take place as follows:<br>
		If you are the owner of the patch, you may not review your own patch. You may respond to comments, defend, abandon, or modify your patch, but you cannot +1 or +2 your own commit.<br><br>
		If you are the first reviewer, then you may review the patch with a +1, but cannot +2 the patch until a second reviewer has also +1 or +2'd the same patch.<br><br>
		If a patch already has a +1, and there are no -1 or -2s, then you may +2 the patch and submit the patch. At this point the patch's branch will be merged to the master branch.<br><br>
		Anyone, at anytime (including the submitter), can -1, -2, comment, and make suggestions. In general, a -1 implies that the patch's core is good, but needs a few tweaks before it should be merged (styling, bugs, typos, better implementation  etc). A -2 implies that the patch is fundamentally broken/flawed, contrary to our goal, or needs to be seriously reworked. A -2 suggests that the patch should not be merged and likely abandoned.<br><br>
	    <h5>Team Behavior </h5> <br>
		If you will be late to a meeting email everyone <br>
		If two people are ready for the meeting and five mintues passes start the meeting <br><br>
		
		<h5>Email Practices </h5> <br>
		Reply within a day or heaven help you for the consequences at which point the requester of information can decied the answer and will email you with what you decided. <br><br>

		<h5>Communication </h5> <br>
		Email and text are good ways to communicate <br><br>

		Shit hit the fan what do we do <br> <br>
		Broke the build: Roll back to working version <br>
		Removed the Git Repo : Kill them....slowly <br>
		Can not make deadline: <br>
		Let team know as soon as possible so that you can see if a teammate can pick up the slack <br><br>

		If the team can not make a deadline weekends are sacrificed to Dennis Ritchie (24 hour hackathon) <br>
