             We are making a crowdfunded marketplace for open government data, creating finanical incentives for uploading public records. <br>
             <br>
         <h5>Project Introduction </h5>
             Open-Data NC is a public website that facilitates acquiring public data from government entities in North Carolina. The website allows people to request, search for, and contribute data, creating a central hub for accessing public records, ultimately leading to a more transparent government. We want to add a kickstarter-like feature to the website through crowdfunding and crowdsourcing, providing addtional incentives for contributing data.

      <h3> Requirements Deliverables </h3>
          <h5> User Stories </h5>
          <div>
             <h5>Requests</h5>
  	        <h5>Request Data<br></h5>
                   <p>Ernie is working on an article related to restaurant health codes. After doing some quick research he cannot find what he believes should be public information related to ranking and health code violations. Ernie cannot find the information himself, and wants to request that someone else locate it for him.<br></p>
 
		<h5>Adding (initial bounty)<br></h5>
		   <p>Ernie has made a request for data on restaurants which he really needs for his article. He is willing to add a financial incentive to encourage researches to find his info.<br></p>
 
		<h5>Adding Bounty (ies) associated with dates<br></h5>
	           <p>Ernie’s article is due in two weeks.  He needs the info within ten days and is willing to pay $10 for it, but if he could get it within a week he would be willing to pay twice as much. After ten days the info is useless to him. Ernie wants to change the amount of his bounty from $20 to $10 after one week, and to $0 after ten days, but he doesn't want to have to do this manually. He also wants to make sure that potential researchers know when he is going to remove the bounty, so that they'll be encouraged to find the data by his deadline.<br></p>
 
		<h5>Adding bounty to some one else’s requests<br></h5>
        	   <p>Elmo, a user of the site, sees a request for information that he also needs and does not have time to find on his own. Elmo wants to add some of his own money onto the existing bounty, to better entice a researcher.<br></p>

	    <h5>Providing <br></h5>
		<h5>Claim bounty<br></h5>
        	   <p>Bert, a researcher, wants to take his boyfriend out to dinner and could use some extra cash for their anniversary.  He goes to the site and finds a bounty that would suffice annd which has a single (default) deadline. Bert wants to claim the request publicly so that another researcher can't take it.<br></p>
 
		<h5>Claim bounty with specific deadline<br></h5>
        	   <p>Bert is searching through the bounty list when he sees a bounty he wants to claim. He notices the bounty has multiple deadlines and knows that he can get the information by deadline x. He wants to publicly claim the request with a promise to acquire the info by that time.<br></p>
 
		<h5>Claim a deadline soon then first claim.<br></h5>
       	           <p>Bert sees a bounty that has already been claimed.  He checks the claim and sees that the researcher has promised to get the information by a late deadline. Bert knows that he can do it by an earlier deadline, which is worth more to the requesters.  He wants to replace the current researcher's claim with a better claim, and become the sole researcher for the request.<br></p>
 
 		<h5>Loses a Claim<br></h5>
		   <p>Bert has claimed a request with a promise to get the information at  a late deadline. He knows this means that another researcher Bert receives an email that a bounty he committed to has been claimed at an earlier deadline by someone else.<br><br></p>
