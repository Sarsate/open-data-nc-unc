             We are making a crowdfunded marketplace for open government data, creating finanical incentives for uploading public records. <br>
             <br>
         <h5>Project Introduction </h5>
             Open-Data NC is a public website that facilitates acquiring public data from government entities in North Carolina. The website allows people to request, search for, and contribute data, creating a central hub for accessing public records, ultimately leading to a more transparent government. We want to add a kickstarter-like feature to the website through crowdfunding and crowdsourcing, providing addtional incentives for contributing data.

                   <p>Ernie is working on an article related to restaurant health codes. After doing some quick research he cannot find what he believes should be public information related to ranking and health code violations. Ernie cannot find the information himself, and wants to request that someone else locate it for him.<br></p>
 
		<h5>Adding (initial bounty)<br></h5>
		   <p>Ernie has made a request for data on restaurants which he really needs for his article. He is willing to add a financial incentive to encourage researches to find his info.<br></p>
 
		<h5>Adding Bounty associated with a deadline<br></h5>
	           <p>Ernie’s article is due in two weeks.  He needs the info within ten days and is willing to pay $10 for it. He would like to let suppliers know when he needs the information.<br></p>
 
		<h5>Adding bounty to some one else’s requests<br></h5>
        	   <p>Elmo, a user of the site, sees a request for information that he also needs and does not have time to find on his own. Elmo wants to add some of his own money onto the existing bounty, to better entice a researcher.<br></p>

		<h5>Fork a request for diffrent format<br></h5>
		   <p>Elmo wants the information that Ernie has requested however instead of in a pdf he needs it in a cvs format.  Elmo forks Erines request and adds his own bounty for the information in his format.<br></p>

		   <p>Elmo wants the information that Erine has requested however he wants it sooner. He forks Erines request to have his own bounty with the ealier deadline.<br></p>

		<h5>Claim bounty<br></h5>
        	   <p>Bert, a researcher, wants to take his boyfriend out to dinner and could use some extra cash for their anniversary.  He goes to the site and finds a bounty that would suffice annd which has a single (default) deadline. Bert wants to claim the request publicly so that another researcher can't take it.<br></p>
  
 		<h5>Loses a Claim<br></h5>
		   <p>Bert has claimed a request with a promise to get the information at  a late deadline. He knows this means that another researcher Bert receives an email that a bounty he committed to has been claimed at an earlier deadline by someone else.<br><br></p>
